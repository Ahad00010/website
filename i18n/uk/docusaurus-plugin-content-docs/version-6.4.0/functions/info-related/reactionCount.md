This will return the amount of reactions on your message with which you executed the command, will most likely return `1` due to the bot being the only one who reacted to it:

```javascript
bot.command({
    name: 'reactionCount',
    code: `
There are: $reactionCount[$channelID;$messageID;üò´] reactions!
$addCmdReactions[üò´]
`
});
```
