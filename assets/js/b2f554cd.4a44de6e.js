(`reverseReading` method to reverse bottom to top)\\n- **Insensitive Functions**: By **default** it will now read function with case-case-sensitive. (`insensitiveReading` method to disable this)\\n- **Removal of `all` intents**: No one needed this and it\'s inefficient to use this (ram consumption)\\n- **Interaction Commands**: It will be more natively easier to add slash commands, button commands, select menu, and the other based interactions.\\n- **Embed Parser Removal**: No more needing embed parsing since it will now **accept** functions inside of **error statement** and one another.\\n- **Types of commmands**: Instead of `bot.command` -> `bot.commands.add` to support many new types.\\n- **Adding events**: In favor of adding easier events, `bot.onMessage()` -> `bot.addEvent(\\"onMessage\\")`\\n- **Command Handler**: It has been reverted to v4 in favor of simpler and quick command loading.\\n- **Entire package built-in TS**: It now natively built-in TypeScript and won\'t affect any users using `.js` as it\'s compiled into `JavaScript` and proper typings.\\n- **Function Manager**: Due to the new core, custom functions will need to be updated with the new methods, as it\'s now natively cache and properly supported. (**sideloading support**)\\n- **Status Manager**: The basic method to add a Client Status has changed and shouldn\'t be hard to change.\\n- **Database Manager**: With the new built-in database support of Akarui Development Team (**aoi.db**) it\'s now fully interagted and able to transfer your old **dbdjs.db** with ease and no corruption.\\n- **Compact functions removal**: No one truly used this and it\'s not what most users want at the moment.\\n- **Several functions changes**: For those who prefer copy an paste or see all function usage changes or names, [**Click me**](#) to see all function changes.\\n\\n## Why is there so many changes\\n\\nAll of these changes were going to happen in **v5.0.0** but we delayed them to prevent users being overwhelmed with so many changes.\\n\\n## What if I don\'t want to update\\n\\nOkay, good luck on a year when your Client won\'t startup when your Client runs on a old Discord API that will **force** your Bot to shutdown itself.\\nJust mirgate, there\'s a [**Support Server**](https://aoi.js.org/invite) and **[Documentation](https://aoi.js.org/docs)** to begin.\\n\\n## Are you going to finally update Documentation\\n\\nYes, I will maintain and manage documentation properly for a fast and easier migration for all users, this is the new beginning of aoi.js growth.\\n\\n## More features\\n\\nJust wait after of v6.0.0, there is going to be crazy things rolling out after.\\n\\n## Why can\'t I find the source on Github\\n\\nIt\'s closed source till v7.0.0.\\n\\n## What\'s next of aoi.js v6.0.0\\n\\nOnce v6.0.0 is released, v7.0.0 will be in work, but perhaps it already is being worked on..?"}]}')}}]);
