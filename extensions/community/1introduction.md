## Community Extensions

Community Extensions are a way to add more functionality to aoi.js which would normally not get added by aoi.js developers.

  - aoi.canvas is a NPM package created by [devlordduck2](https://discord.com/users/1096717977304453160) which adds the ability to use canvas to aoi.js
- [aoi.js-library@1.0.1](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aoi.js-library?activeTab=readme)
  - aoi.js-library is a NPM package created by [leref](https://discord.com/users/608358453580136499) which adds the ability to load & create plugins to aoi.js.

## Create your own Extension

Creating your very own extension is rather a task for an advanced user with javascript knowledge. 

You can still create Extensions for aoi.js and let us know about it! If it's useful you'll get your own section on this page.
