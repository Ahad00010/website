        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As version 6.0.0-dev is almost ready for testing and for users to begin, there's some things you should be aware of first!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-going-to-change">What's going to change<a href="#whats-going-to-change" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What's going to change" title="Direct link to What's going to change">​</a></h2><p>The biggest changes that will occur is:</p><ul><li><strong>Starting your Client</strong>: To startup your Client before anything <code>bot.start()</code> is now needed.</li><li><strong>Reading Functions</strong>: By <strong>default</strong> it will now read to top to bottom. (<code>reverseReading</code> method to reverse bottom to top)</li><li><strong>Insensitive Functions</strong>: By <strong>default</strong> it will now read function with case-case-sensitive. (<code>insensitiveReading</code> method to disable this)</li><li><strong>Removal of <code>all</code> intents</strong>: No one needed this and it's inefficient to use this (ram consumption)</li><li><strong>Interaction Commands</strong>: It will be more natively easier to add slash commands, button commands, select menu, and the other based interactions.</li><li><strong>Embed Parser Removal</strong>: No more needing embed parsing since it will now <strong>accept</strong> functions inside of <strong>error statement</strong> and one another.</li><li><strong>Types of commmands</strong>: Instead of <code>bot.command</code> -&gt; <code>bot.commands.add</code> to support many new types.</li><li><strong>Adding events</strong>: In favor of adding easier events, <code>bot.onMessage()</code> -&gt; <code>bot.addEvent("onMessage")</code></li><li><strong>Command Handler</strong>: It has been reverted to v4 in favor of simpler and quick command loading.</li><li><strong>Entire package built-in TS</strong>: It now natively built-in TypeScript and won't affect any users using <code>.js</code> as it's compiled into <code>JavaScript</code> and proper typings.</li><li><strong>Function Manager</strong>: Due to the new core, custom functions will need to be updated with the new methods, as it's now natively cache and properly supported. (<strong>sideloading support</strong>)</li><li><strong>Status Manager</strong>: The basic method to add a Client Status has changed and shouldn't be hard to change.</li><li><strong>Database Manager</strong>: With the new built-in database support of Akarui Development Team (<strong>aoi.db</strong>) it's now fully interagted and able to transfer your old <strong>dbdjs.db</strong> with ease and no corruption.</li><li><strong>Compact functions removal</strong>: No one truly used this and it's not what most users want at the moment.</li><li><strong>Several functions changes</strong>: For those who prefer copy an paste or see all function usage changes or names, <a href="#"><strong>Click me</strong></a> to see all function changes.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-is-there-so-many-changes">Why is there so many changes<a href="#why-is-there-so-many-changes" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why is there so many changes" title="Direct link to Why is there so many changes">​</a></h2><p>All of these changes were going to happen in <strong>v5.0.0</strong> but we delayed them to prevent users being overwhelmed with so many changes.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-if-i-dont-want-to-update">What if I don't want to update<a href="#what-if-i-dont-want-to-update" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What if I don't want to update" title="Direct link to What if I don't want to update">​</a></h2><p>Okay, good luck on a year when your Client won't startup when your Client runs on a old Discord API that will <strong>force</strong> your Bot to shutdown itself.
Just mirgate, there's a <a href="https://aoi.js.org/invite" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Support Server</strong></a> and <strong><a href="https://aoi.js.org/docs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Documentation</a></strong> to begin.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="are-you-going-to-finally-update-documentation">Are you going to finally update Documentation<a href="#are-you-going-to-finally-update-documentation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Are you going to finally update Documentation" title="Direct link to Are you going to finally update Documentation">​</a></h2><p>Yes, I will maintain and manage documentation properly for a fast and easier migration for all users, this is the new beginning of aoi.js growth.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="more-features">More features<a href="#more-features" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to More features" title="Direct link to More features">​</a></h2><p>Just wait after of v6.0.0, there is going to be crazy things rolling out after.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-cant-i-find-the-source-on-github">Why can't I find the source on Github<a href="#why-cant-i-find-the-source-on-github" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why can't I find the source on Github" title="Direct link to Why can't I find the source on Github">​</a></h2><p>It's closed source till v7.0.0.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-next-of-aoijs-v600">What's next of aoi.js v6.0.0<a href="#whats-next-of-aoijs-v600" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What's next of aoi.js v6.0.0" title="Direct link to What's next of aoi.js v6.0.0">​</a></h2><p>Once v6.0.0 is released, v7.0.0 will be in work, but perhaps it already is being worked on..?</p>]]></content>
